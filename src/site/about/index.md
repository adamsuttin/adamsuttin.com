### About this site

In the first place and on the whole, this site is an adventure—I might even call it a journey, though most accurately it is my small corner of the web—my personal design and sandbox, always in some sort of transition, a work in progress.

### Behind the Scenes

I've been creating this site with the help of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator and host it in [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).

### Copyright

I retain all copyrights to the design, code and content on adamsuttin.com. All original code examples displayed within a post on this site is for the public domain. Code presented as samples or examples from third-party software or repository still retain any owner's copyrights.
