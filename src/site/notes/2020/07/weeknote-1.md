- Spend a good chunk of the week getting this site designed and developed with Eleventy. The biggest issues I think I resolved was getting tagging to work across different sections. I don't want to have same tags and same tag pages across all of them&mdash;I want separate tags and tag pages for each section. I finally created `tagged` filter on my custom collections.
- Speaking of sections, I went with very similar structure and templates for all sections to get me started (which resulted in duplication of a lot of partial templates I use). I think that once I have some more content, I will generalize those templates and trash those duplicates, and use CSS to create a distinct feel for each section.
- I have still not gone to register our car. I was supposed to do by the end of last month. We had not been driving that much except to get grocery shopping once a week and I figured I could procrastinate a little longer. It eats at me and I know I have to do this before our trip to [Branson, Missouri](https://www.branson.com/) next Friday.
- We are going for a long drive. Finally! It is going to over seven hours one way. We decided that we needed to take a break from this involuntary house arrest and scout out Branson before our longer vacation there in the middle of October. We have already booked Airbnb place with a nice view out the window for a reasonble price of less that $1,000 for 14 nights.
